# üìÑ‚úè Sensor Fault Detection Project
- Project Overview:
This project focuses on utilizing machine learning for the automated detection of faulty wafers, critical components in the manufacturing of solar cells and integrated circuits. Wafers, housing hundreds of sensors and undergoing intricate microfabrication processes, play a pivotal role in photovoltaic power generation.

- Problem Statement:
The existing manual inspection of wafers, when suspected to be faulty, results in disruptive halts in the production process. False suspicions lead to unnecessary costs in terms of time, manpower, and resources. The goal is to automate this detection process and prevent these interruptions.

- Approach:
The project employs a machine learning pipeline, particularly utilizing the Random Forest model, to process and analyze the data collected from the wafers. This model aims to accurately identify faulty wafers, eliminating the need for manual inspection.

- Impact:
By implementing this solution, the project aims to significantly reduce the reliance on manual labor, thereby minimizing operational disruptions and cutting down on associated costs in wafer production."
